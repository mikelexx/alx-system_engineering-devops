**Background Context**
You have been given 2 additional servers:

- gc-[STUDENT_ID]-web-02-XXXXXXXXXX
- gc-[STUDENT_ID]-lb-01-XXXXXXXXXX
Let’s improve our web stack so that there is redundancy for our web servers. This will allow us to be able to accept more traffic by doubling the number of web servers, and to make our infrastructure more reliable. If one web server fails, we will still have a second one to handle requests.

For this project, you will need to write Bash scripts to automate your work. All scripts must be designed to configure a brand new Ubuntu server to match the task requirements.

**Resources**

**Tasks**
0. Double the number of webservers
mandatory
In this first task you need to configure web-02 to be identical to web-01. Fortunately, you built a Bash script during your web server project, and they’ll now come in handy to easily configure web-02. Remember, always try to automate your work!

Since we’re placing our web servers behind a load balancer for this project, we want to add a custom Nginx response header. The goal here is to be able to track which web server is answering our HTTP requests, to understand and track the way a load balancer works. More in the coming tasks.

Requirements:

Configure Nginx so that its HTTP response contains a custom header (on web-01 and web-02)
The name of the custom HTTP header must be X-Served-By
The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
Write `0-custom_http_response_header` so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task
Ignore `SC2154` for `shellcheck`
Example:
```
sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sI 34.198.248.145 | grep X-Served-By
X-Served-By: 03-web-01
sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sI 54.89.38.100 | grep X-Served-By
X-Served-By: 03-web-02
sylvain@ubuntu$
```
If your server’s hostnames are not properly configured (`[STUDENT_ID]-web-01` and `[STUDENT_ID]-web-02`.), follow this [tutorial](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/qSor8ulAHl4HedrO6KJEoQ).
